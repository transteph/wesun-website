# Welcoming Ukrainian Newcomers 
Some pro-bono work building a website with information and resources for Ukranian newcomers to Canada (specifically to the Windsor-Essex region). 

The organization wanted the website to follow the design of the UK's [Ukrainian Welcome Centre](https://www.ukrainianwelcomecentre.org/) where instead of a toggable navigation menu, the user is always presented with menu bar with all of the page links. I liked this design since it presents all of the info at once (I feel like toggable menus may not be as intuitive for every user). Any info that the user wants is right there on the page by default - something really important to users that need relevant info ASAP.
